# fac-application-website

## Summary

A website and application for the Founders and Coders programme. View the live website [at this link](https://lascellesabercrombie.github.io/fac-application-website/) or on the right. 

## Background

The main distinctive feature of this website is the big button allowing the viewer to switch between English and Yiddish versions of the website. I talk a bit more about the motivation for the feature on the website. One aspect that made it particularly interesting to me was that Yiddish is written right to left. I was curious about how this would play out in terms of website design. 

## Requirements

The website was designed to fulfil [these requirements](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/requirements/website), which I've also copied out below: 

### General criteria 

- [x] All code is written by you

- [x] Tells us about why you are applying for the programme
- [x] Hosted on GitHub Pages
- [x] Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
- [x] Links to your public freeCodeCamp profile
- [x] Shows your progress through the weekly prompts (e.g. links to repos, as a project gallery, or in an image carousel)

### Technical criteria 

- [x] Semantic HTML5 elements
- [x] CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
- [x] DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
